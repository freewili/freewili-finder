# FreeWili Finder Example Code Summary

This document provides a complete overview of the example code available for the fwfinder library.

## Available Examples

### 1. C++ Example (`basic_usage.cpp`)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates modern C++ API usage
- **Features**:
  - Uses `std::expected` for error handling
  - Modern C++23 features
  - Type-safe enum classes
  - RAII for automatic resource management
- **Build target**: `basic_usage_cpp`
- **Status**: ✅ Working

### 2. C API Example (`c_api_basic_usage.cpp`)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates C API usage with C++ compilation
- **Features**:
  - Uses C API but compiled as C++
  - Error code based error handling
  - Manual memory management
  - Compatible with modern C++ projects
- **Build target**: `basic_usage_c`
- **Status**: ✅ Working

### 3. Pure C Example (`c_api_basic_usage_pure_c.c`)
- **Purpose**: Pure C implementation for maximum compatibility
- **Features**:
  - 100% C code (no C++ features)
  - C89/C99 compatible
  - Traditional C-style variable declarations
  - C-style comments
- **Build target**: Not yet integrated (reference implementation)
- **Status**: ✅ Created (ready for integration)

## Build Instructions

From the project root:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Run Instructions

From the `build` directory:

```bash
# C++ example
./examples/basic_usage_cpp

# C API example
./examples/basic_usage_c
```

## Example Output

Both examples will detect connected FreeWili devices and display:
- Device name and serial number
- USB hub information
- Individual USB device details (VID/PID, location, ports, etc.)
- Device type classification

## Integration Status

- ✅ C++ library builds successfully
- ✅ C API library builds successfully (shared and static)
- ✅ Examples build and link correctly
- ✅ All tests pass (5/5)
- ✅ CTest integration working
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed C++ goto/variable initialization issue**: Replaced problematic `goto` statements with structured error handling
2. **Fixed C API linking**: Corrected CMake target references for proper library linking
3. **Fixed build dependencies**: Ensured proper dependency chain between libraries and examples
4. **Added comprehensive documentation**: Updated README with detailed usage instructions and example output

The fwfinder library now has comprehensive, working example code for both C++ and C API usage patterns!
